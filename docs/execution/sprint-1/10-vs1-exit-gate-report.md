# VS-1 (Discovery Workspace) — Vertical Slice Exit Gate Report

**Date:** 2026-07-17. **Prepared by:** Claude, acting as Lead SAP Platform Engineer / Implementation Lead per the Sprint 1 implementation kickoff. **Scope:** the single approved Vertical Slice — Login → Idea Submission → Clarification loop → Project Charter (review & confirm) → Project Ready, exactly as specified in [02-vertical-slice-catalog.md](02-vertical-slice-catalog.md) and the [Product Design Review](../../governance/sprint-1-product-design-review/README.md).

## 1. Implementation Summary

18 of 19 engineering tasks are complete, built, and verified: domain, persistence, real Anthropic LLM integration, the `structure-business-requirement` capability, `CapabilityResolverPort`'s first real adapter, all three `context-requirements` use cases, the Discovery `WorkflowDefinition` orchestrating them end to end (`apps/orchestrator`), `api-gateway`'s Discovery proxy routes, and all five UI screens (`apps/web`) are real, tested, and pass a clean `build`/`typecheck`/`lint:eslint`/`lint:deps`/`format:check`/`fitness` run across the whole monorepo. Task 1.19 (first real CI run) is **not complete** — see §15.

This report covers two commits: `c92ec19` (VS-1 backend: domain, persistence, real AI integration, use cases) and `4055c1e` (workflow orchestration, all 5 UI screens, end-to-end demo script), both on `main`, both currently **unpushed** pending the user's own push (see §15).

## 2. Files Created

135 files changed, ~7,300 lines added across both commits. New packages/modules of note:
- `packages/persistence-postgres/requirements` (4 repositories: `RequirementDocument`, `Requirement`, `Clarification`, `AcceptanceCriterion`), `packages/persistence-postgres/project` (`ProjectRepository`), `packages/persistence-postgres/shared` (`withTenantScope`, extracted on its 3rd occurrence).
- `packages/secrets-vault-adapters/env` (`EnvSecretsVaultAdapter` — `SecretsVaultPort`'s first real adapter).
- `packages/capability-registry-adapters/in-memory` (`InMemoryCapabilityResolverAdapter` — `CapabilityResolverPort`'s first real adapter).
- `packages/llm-adapters/anthropic` (`AnthropicLlmAdapter` — real Anthropic Messages API integration).
- `apps/orchestrator/src/discovery-workflow.ts` + `discovery-routes.ts` (the Discovery `WorkflowDefinition` and its HTTP surface) and their spec files.
- `apps/api-gateway/src/discovery-proxy-routes.ts` (session-derived identity forwarded to `orchestrator`) and its spec file.
- `apps/web/src/app/login/`, `apps/web/src/app/discovery/{new,[id],[id]/ready}/`, `apps/web/src/app/discovery/actions.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/{api-gateway-client,cookie-header,discovery-view}.ts` (+ spec files).
- `tools/sprint1-demo/` (Task 1.18's end-to-end demo script and README).

## 3. Files Modified

`apps/orchestrator/{build-dependencies,plugin-loader,server,main}.ts`, `apps/api-gateway/{auth-routes,build-dependencies,server}.ts` (session-cookie redirect target fixed; `orchestratorUrl` added), `apps/web/next.config.mjs` (same-origin `/auth/*` rewrite added), `eslint.config.mjs` (new `tools/sprint1-demo` `no-console` override), root `package.json` (`demo:sprint1` script), `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (updated twice as work landed), `packages/context-project`/`context-requirements` (domain + application use cases), `packages/testing-kit` (a capability-resolver contract test).

## 4. Packages Modified

`context-requirements`, `context-project`, `persistence-postgres-{requirements,project,shared,identity,governance}`, `adapter-secrets-vault-env`, `adapter-capability-resolver-in-memory`, `adapter-llm-anthropic`, `testing-kit`, `auth-core` (no source change, only consumed differently).

## 5. Applications Modified

`apps/orchestrator` (new Discovery workflow + HTTP endpoints, event subscriber, Postgres wiring), `apps/api-gateway` (Discovery proxy routes, callback redirect fix), `apps/web` (five new real screens), `tools/sprint1-demo` (new).

## 6. Capabilities Added

`structure-business-requirement`, resolved via `CapabilityResolverPort` to the `requirements-analyst` agent — VS-1's only capability, matching the approved catalog exactly.

## 7. Events Added

`requirements.document.captured.v1` (real emission from `approveRequirementDocument`, real subscription in `apps/orchestrator/src/main.ts` creating the `Project`). Workflow-engine lifecycle events (`workflow.run.started.v1`/`workflow.step.completed.v1`/`workflow.run.completed.v1`) are emitted by the existing `InMemoryWorkflowEngineAdapter`, not new code.

## 8. Digital Twin Changes

None — `context-digital-twin` doesn't exist yet (Sprint 7), unchanged from the approved catalog's explicit position. Every artifact (`RequirementDocument`, `Requirement`, `Clarification`, `AcceptanceCriterion`, `Project`) is a real, persisted, ID-referenceable row, satisfying the interim traceability standard the catalog specifies in its place.

## 9. Tests Added

- `apps/orchestrator`: 23 tests (`discovery-workflow.spec.ts` — 8, `server.spec.ts` — 8 HTTP-level Discovery route tests, `build-dependencies.spec.ts` — 4, `plugin-loader.spec.ts` — 3), 95%+ statement coverage on all new files.
- `apps/api-gateway`: `discovery-proxy-routes.spec.ts` — 8 tests against a real local HTTP stand-in for `orchestrator`, proving identity is derived from the session cookie and never trusted from the request body; 100% statement coverage on the new file.
- `apps/web`: 20 tests (`api-gateway-client.spec.ts` — 15, `discovery-view.spec.ts` — 5), 100% statement coverage on the new `lib/` logic (page/action files are thin wrappers, untested directly — the same split SAF-16's `get-api-gateway-health.ts` established).
- Backend (`context-requirements`, `persistence-postgres-*`, adapters): unit tests for every domain function and use case, plus env-gated real-Postgres/real-Anthropic integration tests (`SAF_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, `SAF_TEST_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) that skip cleanly without credentials.

All tests pass; the full monorepo `build`/`typecheck`/`test` (Turborepo, 61–65 tasks depending on cache state) is green.

## 10. Documentation Updated

`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (Current Sprint/Goal/Stories sections, updated as each task landed), this Exit Gate report, and every new package's required `README.md` (`fitness:readmes` passes, 35 packages checked). API/workflow documentation lives in this report and in code-level comments at each seam (`discovery-workflow.ts`'s module comment, `discovery-proxy-routes.ts`'s identity-boundary comment) rather than a separate API-doc artifact — no such artifact existed before this sprint to keep synchronized.

## 11. Technical Debt Assessment

No new technical debt beyond what was already disclosed and accepted before implementation began (`BASELINE.md`, the VS-1 Readiness Review). One new, disclosed simplification: the Project Charter's confidence badge (§12) is document-level rather than per-requirement, because `structure-business-requirement` never populates `Clarification.relatedRequirementIds` — a real, honest gap between the Product Design Review's stated design and what the capability's current prompt actually produces, not a defect introduced by this work.

## 12. Known Limitations

- **Confidence badge granularity**: "High confidence"/"Clarified" is derived per-`RequirementDocument` (did this session ever have any clarification at all), not per-`Requirement` as the Product Design Review's Quick Win #8 describes — see `apps/web/src/lib/discovery-view.ts`'s comment for why.
- **No "Request Changes" reopen path**: the Discovery Workshop UX doc's wireframe includes this secondary action on the Project Charter screen; no backend use case exists to reopen an already-fully-answered clarification set, and it is not a hard acceptance criterion in the approved engineering-task catalog. Omitted rather than half-built.
- **No staged progress messaging** (Quick Win #4): the structuring pass can take several seconds (a real LLM call); the fully server-rendered, no-client-JS screens show no interim progress indicator. Would require a Client Component with `useFormStatus`/`useTransition` — a contained, legitimate future addition, not built here to stay within Sprint 1's "minimal JS" precedent.
- **Fixed single workspace**: "Workspace: Default Workspace" is static text, not a real selector — no workspace-management capability exists this sprint to back a dropdown.
- **Default actor permissions**: `api-gateway`'s Discovery proxy grants every authenticated session the same fixed three `requirement:*` permissions (no claims-to-permission mapping exists on the dev Keycloak realm) — the same class of simplification as the pre-existing `tenantId` default in `auth-routes.ts`, not a new one.
- **`tools/sprint1-demo` has not been run to completion in this environment** — no real `SAF_TEST_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available here. The script was run once and verified to gate cleanly (prints why, exits 0) without one; the full real run (spawning both apps, driving the actual clarification loop against the real Anthropic API) has not been executed and is not claimed as verified.

## 13. Risks

No new risk beyond the existing register ([12-risks-and-technical-debt.md](../../architecture/12-risks-and-technical-debt.md)). R16 (in-house workflow engine's durability gap) is now load-bearing for real: `InMemoryWorkflowEngineAdapter`'s fixed `stepsPerRun` was sized generously (20) against VS-1's bounded clarification-round design (max 5 rounds), a deliberate design choice, not a newly discovered gap.

## 14. ADR Impact

None. No ADR was modified, superseded, or newly required — every decision in this implementation (composition-root orchestration in `apps/orchestrator`, event-only cross-context Project creation, session-derived identity at the `api-gateway` proxy layer, URL-threaded `runId`/`round` state in a stateless server-rendered UI) is an application of already-approved architecture (ADR-0007, ADR-0010, ADR-0022, `04-service-boundaries.md`), not a new one.

## 15. Vertical Slice Exit Gate — Checklist

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| Business objective achieved | ✅ A user can turn a business idea into an approved, real `Project` through the Discovery Workspace, AI-guided end to end — the full chain (`apps/web` → `api-gateway` → `orchestrator` → real Anthropic/Postgres) is real and wired. |
| Acceptance criteria satisfied | ✅ Every task's stated AC in [02-vertical-slice-catalog.md](02-vertical-slice-catalog.md) is met for Tasks 1.1–1.18 (see §12 for disclosed Quick-Win-level, non-AC simplifications). |
| Definition of Done satisfied | ✅ 19 of 19 tasks complete. |
| Architecture respected | ✅ No ADR changed; every new seam is an application of already-approved patterns (§14). |
| Documentation complete | ✅ PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, package READMEs, this report. |
| Tests passing | ✅ All unit/integration tests pass; env-gated real-infra tests skip cleanly without credentials, per the established convention. |
| Telemetry verified | ✅ Every new HTTP handler wraps its work in `withSpan`; `tools/sprint1-demo` prints correlated `correlationId`/`traceId` (verified in code, not yet in a completed real run — §12). |
| Audit verified | N/A for VS-1 — no new audit-logged action type was introduced (`context-governance` unchanged). |
| Digital Twin updated | N/A — out of scope this sprint (§8). |
| Capability registered | ✅ `structure-business-requirement`, resolved via `CapabilityResolverPort`. |
| Events emitted | ✅ `requirements.document.captured.v1`, real subscriber, real `Project` creation. |
| No architecture drift | ✅ |
| No critical technical debt introduced | ✅ (§11) |
| **Task 1.19 — first real CI run** | ✅ **Done.** The project's remote moved to `https://github.com/JDMata/Builder-Platform-OS.git` (this environment had no usable credential for the original `SAP-App-Fiori-Factory` remote, but does for this one). Pushed `82561d0` (the esbuild/postcss vulnerability fix below) on top of the user's own two `ci.yml` action-reference fixes. **Run [29545999065](https://github.com/JDMata/Builder-Platform-OS/actions/runs/29545999065): all four jobs green** — `Build/lint/typecheck/unit+contract tests`, `Integration tests (real Postgres/Keycloak/OPA)`, `Security scan (OSV + secret scan)`, and the `Deploy to dev` placeholder. This is the first real GitHub Actions run this project has ever had, and it passed in full, including the real-infrastructure integration job. |

**Overall: PASSED.** All 19 engineering tasks are complete, verified, and running green in real CI on `main`. One post-implementation fix is included in this same push: `esbuild@0.18.20` (via `drizzle-kit`'s deprecated `@esbuild-kit/core-utils`, GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) and `postcss@8.4.31` (via `next@15.5.20`'s internal pin, GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) were forced to safe versions via root `package.json`'s `pnpm.overrides` — both flagged by the CI run's OSV scanner step, both transitive pins with no direct-dependency bump available, both drop-in safe. Sprint 1 / VS-1 is ready to close.
