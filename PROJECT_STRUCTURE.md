# Project Structure

This is the canonical description of the monorepo layout — the single source of truth for "where does this file go." It supersedes the earlier draft at [docs/folder-structure.md](docs/folder-structure.md) (kept only as a pointer here, to avoid two copies of a tree that will otherwise drift apart over 10 years). Reflects the architecture as approved plus the revisions from the principal-architect self-review ([docs/architecture/13-principal-architect-self-review.md](docs/architecture/13-principal-architect-self-review.md)) — package granularity is one package per bounded context (ADR-0018), not one package per layer per context.

Everything under `plugins/` and the `*-adapters` directories is stub-only until a feature sprint gives it real logic — the goal of the current phase is to prove the seams exist and are enforced, not to implement capability. See [ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md](ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md) and [ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md](ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md) for the rules this structure exists to enforce.

## Placement rules (quick reference)

- **"Is this SAP-specific?"** → `plugins/<name>/`. Never any `packages/context-*` folder.
- **"Does this talk to a third-party SDK (LLM, MCP transport, cloud storage, an ORM)?"** → an `*-adapters/<vendor>` package or `persistence-postgres`, behind the matching port. Never imported directly by a context's `src/application/`.
- **"Is this a business rule with no I/O?"** → `packages/context-<name>/src/domain/`.
- **"Is this a use case coordinating domain + ports?"** → `packages/context-<name>/src/application/`.
- **"Is this a runnable process with its own deploy lifecycle?"** → `apps/*`, and it must be listed in [docs/architecture/04-service-boundaries.md](docs/architecture/04-service-boundaries.md).
- **"Is this a cross-aggregate/cross-context read query for a dashboard or list view?"** → `packages/read-models/*`, queried directly — never bent into an aggregate repository call. See [ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-cqrs-read-models.md).
- **"Does this touch a credential for a customer's own SAP system (not the platform's own operational secrets)?"** → the Connection Management concept in `context-project`, behind `TargetSystemConnection`, never the generic `secrets-vault` port. See [ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-target-system-credential-management.md).
- **"Is this a cross-cutting interface with no implementation (an abstraction every layer depends on)?"** → `packages/ports/`, never mixed into a context or adapter package.
- **"Is this a port or adapter consumed by a *generated application* at its own runtime (persistence, auth, authz, messaging, storage, SAP connectivity, external APIs)?"** → `packages/generated-app-kit/`, never `packages/ports/` (which is for the platform's own runtime) and never hand-rolled inside a plugin. See [ADR-0019](docs/adr/0019-execution-profiles-for-generated-applications.md).
- **"Does a new bounded context or a new deployable app need scaffolding?"** → run the generator in `tools/generators`, don't hand-write the boilerplate.

## Why this structure, briefly

Every top-level folder maps to exactly one of the architectural layers in [ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md](ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md): `apps/` is the composition-root layer, `packages/context-*` is domain+application, `packages/ports` is the abstraction seam, `*-adapters`/`persistence-postgres`/`object-storage-minio` are the adapter layer, `plugins/` is the SAP-specific extension layer kept structurally outside the core, and `packages/read-models` is the one deliberate exception to "queries go through aggregate repositories" (see [ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-cqrs-read-models.md)). If a new file doesn't obviously fit one of these, that's a signal to ask before creating a new top-level convention — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
